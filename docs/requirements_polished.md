# 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose  
This document describes the requirements, structure, and design principles of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework to be built and run on Databricks. The framework is intended to be extensible, metadata-driven, and developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) best practices. 

### 1.2 Scope  
- **Core**: Basic ingestion, transformation, and loading capabilities using Databricks’ built-in connectors and Delta Lake.  
- **Extensions**: Additional, customizable functionality to adapt the framework to specific business or technical needs (e.g., custom transformations, connectors, validations).  
- **Utilities**: Supplementary tools that enhance user experience (e.g., migration toolsets, data discovery) and can be integrated with the core or used standalone.  

### 1.3 Goals and Objectives  
1. Provide a single, consistent approach to ETL using OOP, metadata-driven configurations, and best coding practices (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI).  
2. Ensure easy adoption of Databricks native features (Unity Catalog, built-in connectors, Delta Lake, etc.).  
3. Offer strong integration points with data governance solutions (Azure Purview, Unity Catalog) and data observability.  
4. Simplify data lineage tracking (including column-level lineage), data security, and encryption requirements.  
5. Facilitate serverless and cluster-based deployment strategies with minimal changes.  
6. Streamline future migration to other platforms (e.g., Microsoft Fabric, on-prem Spark) with minimal refactoring.

To ensure completeness and correctness, the following roles have reviewed the requirements:

1. **Data Strategist**: Ensures alignment with business and governance strategies.  
2. **Data Architect**: Validates overall architecture, modular design, and adherence to enterprise standards.  
3. **Data Scientist**: Provides insights on advanced transformations, data quality, and monitoring.  
4. **Data Engineer**: Focuses on ingestion, transformations, scheduling, and performance.  
5. **Data Analyst**: Ensures data availability, quality, and consistency for analytical use cases.  
6. **Data PMO (Project Management Office)**: Monitors scope, timeline, risk management, and resource allocation.

Each role’s feedback has been incorporated into the sections below.

# 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Metadata-Driven Design
1. **Configuration Storage**  
   - All pipeline definitions, transformations, and operational parameters must be stored in metadata.  
   - Evaluate using **YAML** as the default metadata format due to its readability and support in Python.  
   - Optionally consider other formats (JSON, TOML, etc.) if they add significant benefits (e.g., better tooling or fewer limitations on parameter usage).

2. **Pipeline Definition**  
   - Each data pipeline is defined in metadata, which includes:  
     - Source system details (type of connector, path/URL, credential references).  
     - Transformation logic (built-in Spark SQL, PySpark transformations, or extension references).  
     - Loading rules (Delta table location, partitioning, mode—overwrite, append, merge, etc.).  
     - Validation and post-load checks (data quality rules, schema checks).  
   - Must provide a flexible structure to incorporate new fields and logic without impacting existing pipelines.

### 3.2 Core (Ingestion, Transformation, Loading)
1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Read data only from Databricks’ supported built-in connectors (e.g., Kafka, cloud file systems by Autoloader like S3/Azure Data Lake, etc.).  
   - Provide a base Ingestion class to handle different source systems through specialized subclasses or parameter-driven logic.
   - Support both batch and streaming data ingestion.

2. **Data Transformation**  
   - Transform data via:  
     - PySpark DataFrame APIs.  
     - Spark SQL.  
   - A base Transformation class with method stubs for typical operations (filtering, joining, enriching, pivoting, etc.).  
   - Must allow chaining or orchestration of multiple transformations.

3. **Data Loading**  
   - Load data into Delta tables by default (managed tables by default, optionally external tables).  
   - Must support **Unity Catalog** to organize Delta tables.  
   - Provide robust handling for write modes (append, overwrite, merge) and SCD patterns (Type 1, 2, 3).  

4. **Data Validation**  
   - Perform post-load checks for data quality, schema conformance, and data types.  
   - Consider integration with **Great Expectations** or **Databricks Labs DQ** for advanced rule definitions and automated test suites.  

5. **Data Lineage**  
   - Primarily utilize **Unity Catalog** for lineage harvesting.  
   - Provide hooks or extension points for custom lineage capture to address potential gaps (especially column-level lineage).  
   - Support easy integration with **Azure Purview** or other third-party governance tools.

6. **Data Monitoring**  
   - Integrate or provide hooks for advanced monitoring (e.g., data drift, schema changes).  
   - Expose metrics or events that can be consumed by Databricks’ native monitoring or third-party observability platforms.

7. **Data Governance**  
   - **Encryption**: Must be part of the core. Ensure data is encrypted at rest and in transit.  
   - Access Control: Defer to Unity Catalog for fine-grained privileges; ensure the framework does not introduce security loopholes.  
   - Classification, Masking, Sharing: Provide extension points to incorporate business rules or third-party solutions (or Databricks Unity Catalog).

8. **Data Observability**  
   - Must define interfaces for tracking latency, performance, and cost.  
   - Provide a consistent way to store and expose these metrics for use by extension modules or external observability tools.

9. **Data Retention**  
   - Include methods or configuration options for data archiving and deletion.  
   - Ensure compliance with business or regulatory data retention policies.  

### 3.3 Extensions
1. **Custom Connectors**  
   - Extend core ingestion classes to read from niche or proprietary systems (e.g. use maven package to read data from DB2, etc.).  
2. **Custom Transformations**  
   - Implement domain-specific logic or advanced transformations (e.g., machine learning feature engineering).  
3. **Custom Validations/Monitoring**  
   - Use a plugin-based approach so new or specialized data checks can be added without altering the core.  
4. **Custom Governance/Security**  
   - Integrate with advanced governance platforms or custom security measures not covered by the core.  
5. **Design & Implementation**  
   - Follow the same OOP principles.  
   - Code may reside in Databricks notebooks or separate Python modules, registered and invoked by the framework’s extension manager.

### 3.4 Utilities
1. **Migration Toolset**  
   - Assist in migrating from existing catalogs or data structures to Unity Catalog.  
2. **Data Discovery**  
   - Provide quick profiling, schema detection, and exploration of new sources.  
3. **Standalone or Integrated**  
   - Utilities can be integrated with the core pipeline or used independently.  
   - Packaged separately if needed to minimize dependencies.

# 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance and Scalability
- Must leverage Spark’s distributed computing capabilities for large volumes of data.  
- Support both **serverless** and **shared** cluster architectures in Databricks.  
- Future-proof design enabling easy migration to other Spark-based platforms (e.g., Microsoft Fabric).

### 4.2 Security
- End-to-end encryption for data at rest and in transit.  
- Integration with Unity Catalog for secure data access.  
- Ability to integrate with external identity providers and key management systems if needed.

### 4.3 Reliability and Availability
- Must have robust **error handling** and **logging**.  
- Automatic retry or rollback in case of failures.  
- Clear separation of concerns between ingestion, transformation, and loading to isolate and debug issues.

### 4.4 Usability
- **User-friendly** configuration and pipeline definitions.  
- Clear documentation and examples of how to create, deploy, and manage pipelines.  
- Support for **CI/CD** integration, ensuring code, metadata, and configurations can be version-controlled and tested.

### 4.5 Maintainability
- 100% statement coverage in **unit tests** for core functionalities.  
- Comprehensive **integration/functional tests** covering end-to-end scenarios.  
- Encapsulate environment differences (e.g., dev, test, prod) through metadata or configuration injection.
