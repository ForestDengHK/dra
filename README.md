# DRA (Databricks Reference Architecture)

A metadata-driven ETL framework built for Databricks, designed with extensibility, maintainability, and best practices in mind.

## Purpose

DRA provides a robust, metadata-driven ETL framework that:
1. Implements a consistent approach to ETL using OOP and metadata-driven configurations
2. Leverages Databricks native features (Unity Catalog, built-in connectors, Delta Lake)
3. Ensures strong data governance and observability
4. Simplifies data lineage tracking and security requirements
5. Supports both serverless and cluster-based deployments
6. Maintains platform flexibility for future migrations
